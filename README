The Image Processing App requires Python and the following libraries:

Tkinter
Pillow (PIL)
NumPy
OpenCV (cv2)

To install the required libraries, run the following command:
pip install pillow numpy opencv-python

Execution: (From inside the Final Project directory)
python .\image_processing.py


I also attached a folder called images which you may use to experiment and test out my app

For more information on how it works and how to use it you can check the documentation pdf
